            <div class="text-light"><p>This verse is a pivotal moment in the story of Gideon, one of the judges of Israel</p>
            <p>In the book of Judges, Israel had fallen into a cycle of sin, where they would turn away from God, face oppression from neighboring nations (in this case, the Midianites), cry out to God for
             help, and then God would raise up a judge to deliver them. Gideon was one of these judges.<p>
            <p><i class="text-info">In Judges 6:14, </i> Gideon has an encounter with the Lord. The angel of the Lord had appeared to him earlier and informed him that God had chosen him to deliver Israel from the oppression of the
             Midianites. Gideon, however, is unsure and questions God's choice, citing his own weakness and his family's lowly status.</p>
             <p>In response, the Lord reassures Gideon by saying, "Go in the strength you have and save Israel out of Midian's hand. Am I not sending you?"<br>This statement is signigicant for many reasons:</p>
            <p class="text-info">1. God's Call</p><p> It affirms that God is indeed calling Gideon to be a leader and deliverer of Israel. Despite Gideon's doubts and self-perceived inadequacies, God has chosen him for this important task.</p>
            <p class="text-info">2. God's Presence: </p><p>God's assurance, "Am I not sending you?" reminds Gideon that he is not alone in this mission. The presence and backing of the Lord Himself will be with Gideon, providing him with the 
            strength and guidance needed for success..</p>
            <p class="text-info">3. Human Weakness:</p><p> This verse underscores a common theme in the Bible, where God often chooses unlikely or seemingly weak individuals to accomplish His purposes. It highlights that it is God's strength
             and guidance that ultimately matter, not human capabilities alone.</p>

             As the story progresses, Gideon goes on to lead the Israelites in a remarkable victory over the Midianites with God's help, demonstrating the power of God working through a faithful servant. Judges 6:14 is a pivotal moment in Gideon's
              journey, as it marks his acceptance of God's call and begins the process of his transformation into a mighty leader.<br><br>
